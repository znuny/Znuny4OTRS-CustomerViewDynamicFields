# Dynamic fields in the customer's ticket view

The default OTRS has the capabilities dynamic fields in many views, e.g. ticket note, to activate. Indeed there is no way to do this for the customer interface too. This package adds the Sysconfig option 'Ticket::Frontend::AgentTicketCustomer###DynamicField'. By modifying this settings you control the availability of dynamic fields like you know it from the agent interface.
